ðŸ’§ Smart Water Monitoring
Water scarcity is an increasingly global issue, with urban households contributing significantly to water wastage due to inefficient consumption habits. Traditional water meters provide only cumulative usage data, offering little insight into consumption patterns.

Smart Water Monitoring Systems, powered by Machine Learning, offer predictive insights into water consumption, empowering households to optimize usage and adopt sustainable practices.


ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
Develop a Machine Learning model that predicts daily water consumption for individual households using:

Historical water usage
Household demographics
Weather conditions
Conservation behaviors
